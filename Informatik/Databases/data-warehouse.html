      <h1>Data Warehouse</h1>
      <h2>Data formats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Structured</u></p>
          <p>
            Highly organized and fits into a predefined model or schema. It
            typically includes data in tables with rows and columns, such as
            relational databases. Structured data is easily queryable and
            suitable for analysis using SQL or other structured query languages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Semi-structured</u></p>
          <p>
            Contains some structure but doesn't conform to a rigid schema. It
            might contain tags, metadata, or other markers that provide some
            level of organization. Examples include JSON, XML, and NoSQL
            databases. Although it doesn't adhere to a strict schema, it has
            some level of self-describing structure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Unstructured</u></p>
          <p>
            Lacks a predefined data model or organization. It is raw and doesn't
            fit neatly into databases or spreadsheets. Examples include text
            documents, images, videos, social media posts, emails, and audio
            files. Analyzing unstructured data often involves techniques like
            natural language processing or machine learning.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Data Warehouse</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes
        of structured and integrated data from multiple sources. It is designed
        to support business intelligence, reporting, and data analysis by
        providing a consolidated view of organizational data.
      </p>
      <h2>Build approach FEELT TABELL</h2>
      <h2>Operation Data Store or ODS</h2>
      <p>
        Designed to integrate and consolidate data from various operational
        systems in near real-time. ODS focuses on transactional data and serves
        as an interim repository for data before it gets loaded into the data
        warehouse.
      </p>
      <h2>Enterprise Data Warehouse or EDW:</h2>
      <p>
        A comprehensive and centralized repository that integrates data from
        various sources across an entire organization. It serves as the single
        source of truth for business intelligence and decision-making.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Mart</h2>
      <p>
        A smaller, more department- specific subset of an Enterprise Data
        Warehouse. It's designed to serve the needs of a particular business
        unit, department, or user group. Data marts are optimized for specific
        business functions or departments, allowing for faster query performance
        and analysis.
      </p>
      <h2>Preparation of a data warehouse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Data Integration</u></p>
          <p>
            Process of bringing together data from multiple sources and
            transforming it into a single, consistent format.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Data Modeling</u></p>
          <p>
            Design the structure of the data warehouse. This includes defining
            the entities, attributes, and relationships between the entities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Data Loading</u></p>
          <p>
            Identify and correct errors and inconsistencies in the data. This is
            an important step in the data warehousing process, as it ensures
            that the data is accurate and reliable.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Storage and analysis of a data warehouse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Data Loading</u></p>
          <p>
            Populate the data warehouse with data from the source systems. This
            can be done on a batch or real-time basis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Metadata</u></p>
          <p>
            Describe the structure of the data warehouse, the data types, and
            the relationships between the entities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Data Access and Reporting</u></p>
          <p>
            Data access and reporting tools allow users to query the data
            warehouse and generate reports. These tools are typically used by
            business analysts, data scientists, and other decision-makers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Fact table</h2>
      <p>
        A Fact table in a data warehousing data model consists of one or more
        numeric facts of importance for a business.
      </p>
      <h3>Remark</h3>
      <p>Facts must be consistent with the granularity.</p>
      <h2>Types of facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Additive</u></p>
          <p>
            Can be summed up through all of the dimensions in the fact table.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Semi-Additive</u></p>
          <p>
            Can be summed up for some of the dimensions in the fact table, but
            not the others.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Non-Additive</u></p>
          <p>
            Cannot be summed up for any of the dimensions present in the fact
            table.
          </p>
        </li>
