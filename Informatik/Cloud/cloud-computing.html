      <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>

      <h3>

        Definition
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, and
        on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
        resources—such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and
        services— that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
        management effort or service provider interaction. This model shifts IT
        from a capital- intensive investment to a flexible, service-oriented
        approach.
      </p>

      <h2>Characteristics of the Cloud</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>On-demand self-service</u></p>
          <p>
            Consumers can independently provision computing resources such as
            virtual machines, storage, or network capacity whenever needed.
            Provisioning is automated and does not require direct interaction
            with the cloud provider, enabling faster deployment and
            experimentation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Broad network access</u></p>
          <p>
            Cloud services are available over the network and accessed through
            standard protocols. This promotes use across heterogeneous client
            platforms, including mobile devices, laptops, workstations, and thin
            clients, supporting modern distributed and remote work environments.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Resource pooling</u></p>
          <p>
            The provider pools computing resources to serve multiple consumers
            using a multi-tenant model. Physical and virtual resources are
            dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. Customers
            generally do not know the exact physical location of resources, but
            may specify location at a regional or data-center level. Pooled
            resources include CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Rapid elasticity</u></p>
          <p>
            Capabilities can be elastically scaled up or down, often
            automatically, in response to workload demand. To consumers,
            available resources may appear unlimited, allowing applications to
            handle sudden spikes in traffic without manual intervention.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Measured service</u></p>
          <p>
            Cloud systems automatically monitor, control, and optimize resource
            usage through metering mechanisms. Usage is measured at an
            appropriate level (e.g., storage used, compute hours, network
            traffic), enabling pay-per-use, chargeback, or showback models with
            transparency for both provider and consumer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>As-a-Service Models</h2>
      <p>
        As-a-Service refers to delivering IT capabilities as managed services
        over the cloud. Instead of owning and maintaining infrastructure or
        software, organizations consume services provided and operated by third
        parties. The three primary service models differ in how responsibility
        is shared between provider and consumer: Infrastructure as a Service
        (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
      </p>

      <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
      <p>
        PaaS provides a complete development and deployment environment in the
        cloud, abstracting infrastructure concerns such as servers, operating
        systems, and middleware.
        <br />
        Development teams can build, test, deploy, and scale applications
        without managing the underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus
        on code, application logic, and innovation.
        <br />
        PaaS often acts as an internal platform offering APIs, development
        tools, managed databases, CI/CD pipelines, documentation, and support
        services, forming a key pillar of digital and organizational
        transformation.
      </p>

      <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            IaaS delivers virtualized computing resources that replace
            traditional on-premises hardware.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The cloud provider manages physical infrastructure such as servers,
            storage, networking, and data centers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Organizations retain control over operating systems, middleware,
            applications, and configurations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Resources are managed through APIs or web-based dashboards, enabling
            automation and infrastructure-as-code practices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            IaaS is the most flexible cloud service model and is well suited for
            workloads requiring customization, migration of legacy systems, or
            granular control over infrastructure.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
      <p>
        SaaS delivers fully functional applications over the internet,
        eliminating the need to install, manage, or maintain software locally.
        <br />
        The provider is responsible for updates, patches, security, and
        availability, while customers focus solely on usage.
        <br />
        SaaS applications typically use a multi-tenant architecture to isolate
        customer data and are commonly offered through subscription or
        usage-based pricing models.
      </p>

      <h2>Private Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        A private cloud provides cloud services exclusively to a single
        organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.
        <br />
        It is often chosen by organizations that cannot use public clouds due
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Strict security policies</p></li>
        <li><p>Regulatory or compliance requirements</p></li>
        <li><p>Data sovereignty or latency constraints</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Private Cloud Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Security</u></p>
          <p>
            Data and applications remain within the organization's control,
            making private clouds suitable for sensitive or regulated workloads.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Control and customization</u></p>
          <p>
            Infrastructure can be tailored to specific enterprise standards,
            performance requirements, and security policies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Cost considerations</u></p>
          <p>
            While operational costs may be lower long-term, private clouds
            require significant upfront capital investment and ongoing
            maintenance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Scalability limitations</u></p>
          <p>
            Scaling resources requires planning and procurement, making
            elasticity more limited than in public clouds.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Public Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        A public cloud is owned and operated by a third-party provider and
        delivers shared computing resources to multiple customers over the
        internet. Resources are provisioned automatically through self-service
        portals and APIs, enabling rapid deployment and global scalability.
      </p>

      <h2>Public Cloud Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Scalability and elasticity</u></p>
          <p>
            Near-unlimited resources allow organizations to scale workloads
            dynamically based on demand.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Cost efficiency</u></p>
          <p>
            Low upfront costs and pay-as-you-go pricing reduce capital
            expenditure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Shared responsibility</u></p>
          <p>
            Providers manage infrastructure security, while customers remain
            responsible for data, applications, and access control.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        A hybrid cloud combines private and public cloud environments, allowing
        workloads and data to move between them as business needs change.
        <br />
        This model supports flexibility, cost optimization, regulatory
        compliance, and gradual cloud migration while maintaining a unified
        operational model.
      </p>

      <h2>6 Rs of Cloud Migration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Rehosting</u></p>
          <p>
            Also known as lift-and-shift, this approach migrates applications
            with minimal or no code changes. It is fast but does not fully
            leverage cloud-native capabilities.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Replatforming</u></p>
          <p>
            Introduces limited optimizations to better utilize cloud services
            while keeping the core architecture unchanged.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Repurchasing</u></p>
          <p>
            Replaces existing applications with cloud-native SaaS alternatives,
            often improving efficiency but increasing vendor dependency.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Refactoring / Re-architecting</u></p>
          <p>
            Redesigns applications to be cloud-native, often using
            microservices, containers, and managed services. This approach
            delivers the greatest long-term benefits but requires significant
            time and expertise.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Retiring</u></p>
          <p>
            Decommissions applications that no longer provide business value,
            reducing complexity and operational costs.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><u>Retaining</u></p>
          <p>
            Keeps certain workloads on existing infrastructure due to security,
            compliance, latency, or cost considerations, commonly used during
            long-term hybrid cloud strategies.
          </p>
