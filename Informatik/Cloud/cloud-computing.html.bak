      <p>
        Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient,
        on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
        resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
        management effort or service provider interaction.
      </p>
      <h2>Characteristics of the Cloud</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>On-demand self-service</u></p>
          <p>
            A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such
            as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without
            requiring human interaction with each service provider.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Broad network access</u></p>
          <p>
            Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through
            standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick
            client platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Resource pooling</u></p>
          <p>
            The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple
            consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and
            virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to
            consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that
            the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact
            location of the provided resources but may be able to specify
            location at a higher level of abstraction. Examples of resources
            include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Rapid elasticity</u></p>
          <p>
            Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some
            cases automatically, to scale rapidly UP and DOWN commensurate with
            demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning
            often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity
            at any time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Measured service</u></p>
          <p>
            Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by
            leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction
            appropriate to the type of service. Resource usage can be monitored,
            controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the
            provider and consumer of the utilized service.
          </p>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>As-a-Service</h2>
      <p>
        The term as-a-Service generally means that a third party takes care of
        managing a cloud service for you, so you can focus on more important
        things, like your code and customer relationships. In addition to IaaS,
        there are two main as-a-Service options platform-as-a-service or PaaS
        and software-as-a-service or SaaS.
      </p>
      <h2>Platform as a Service, PaaS</h2>
      <p>
        This model allows you to delegate the responsibilities of maintaining
        servers, updating infrastructure software, and configuring a custom
        platform for application development. <br />
        Software teams can develop and deploy their applications without
        worrying about the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure. This
        allows them to spend more time on development and innovation.
        <br />As a foundation of self-service APs, tools, services, knowledge,
        and support services, all designed as a strictly internal product
        managed by. the way vendor. PaaS becomes a pillar of transformation.
      </p>
      <h2>Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            laaS gives organizations all the benefits of on-premises computing
            resources, without the management overhead.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the laas model, organizations delegate the management of their
            hardware to a third party.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Organizations don't need an on-site data center and don't have to
            worry about physical upgrades or maintenance of these components.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The laaS user has full control of the infrastructure through an API
            or dashboard.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            laaS is the most flexible "as-a-Service" cloud model. It makes it
            easy to: scale, upgrade, and add resources.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Software as a Service, SaaS</h2>
      <p>
        Reduces upfront costs by eliminating the need to purchase software or
        invest in a robust on-premise IT infrastructure. <br />
        SaaS applications leverage a multi-client architecture to isolate
        customer data. The provider takes care of the software: updates,
        corrections, or other general maintenance tasks <br />
        Users interact with the software through a web browser. <br />
        SaaS applications are most often based on subscription models .
      </p>
      <h2>Private Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over
        the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users
        instead of the general public. A private cloud is especially suitable
        for IT managers who want company resources to be available on demand,
        but can't a public cloud, whether due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Security policies</p></li>
        <li><p>Budgets</p></li>
        <li><p>Compliance requirements or regulations</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Private Cloud aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Security</u></p>
          <p>
            Your data and applications remain behind your firewall and are
            accessible only to your enterprise making private clouds better
            suited for processing or storing sensitive data
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Potentially lower TCO</u></p>
          <p>Through lower opex over time</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Greater control and customization</u></p>
          <p>Fit your servers to your enterprise's preferences</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Flexibility</u></p>
          <p>
            Ability to move non-sensitive data to a public cloud to accommodate
            sudden bursts of demand on your private cloud
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Higher costs</u></p>
          <p>
            Increased initial charges and the need to repay costs of the
            equipment you purchase
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Responsibility</u></p>
          <p>
            For operating and maintaining your own data center, IT hardware, and
            enterprise software as well as your own security and compliance
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Less flexibility</u></p>
          <p>In scaling IT resources up or down as your needs change</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Complex Security</u></p>
          <p>Implied challenge in managing security due to the above factors</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Public Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        A public cloud is a pool of virtual resources developed from hardware
        owned and managed by a. third-party company that is automatically
        provisioned and allocated among multiple clients through a self-service
        interface.
      </p>
      <h2>Public Cloud Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Resource allocation:</u></p>
          <p>
            Tenants outside the provider's firewall share cloud services and
            virtual resources that come from the provider's set of
            infrastructure, platforms, and software.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Use agreements:</u></p>
          <p>
            Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis but pay-as-you-go
            models aren't necessary components.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Management:</u></p>
          <p>
            At a minimum, the provider maintains the hardware underneath the
            cloud, supports the network and manages the Virtualization software
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Public Cloud Characteristics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Resource allocation:</u></p>
          <p>
            Tenants outside the provider's firewall share cloud services and

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Public Cloud Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Scalability:</u></p>
          <p>Almost unlimited due to on-demand cloud resources.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Lower capital expenditure, capex:</u></p>
          <p>You don't need to purchase all your own data center equipment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Reliability:</u></p>
          <p>Due to services distributed across multiple data centers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Less control over data security:</u></p>
          <p>
            You never know where and under what geographic or other restrictions
            your data is operating.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Higher operational expenditure, opex:</u></p>
          <p>As you scale performance, your cost-per-hour fees rise.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Community Cloud</h2>
      <p>
        The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
        community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns.
        <br />
        It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the
        organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of
        them, and it may exist on or off premises.
      </p>
      <h2>Community Cloud Aspects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Security:</u></p>
          <p>
            Not accessible to the general public, a community cloud offers
            increased security and privacy. However, complicated definition of
            security and service level agreements or SLAs when sharing data
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Customization:</u></p>
          <p>
            Organizations with similar needs share servers and other cloud
            resources. So it's also more customizable and can be configured to
            the needs of the community.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Cost:</u></p>
          <p>
            The cost of operating and maintaining the infrastructure is shared
            among all users.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Resource:</u></p>
          <p>
            Requires in-house cloud experts depending on where it is deployed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Scalability:</u></p>
          <p>
            A community cloud does not offer nearly unlimited scalability like
            the public cloud.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Performance:</u></p>
          <p>
            It can be less efficient because resources such as storage and
            bandwidth are limited and shared among multiple users.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Popularity:</u></p>
          <p>
            Less popular than other deployment models, making it difficult for
            organizations to find an existing model that meets their needs.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
      <p>A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing model that combines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>At least one private cloud and at least one public cloud</p></li>
        <li><p>two or more private clouds</p></li>
        <li><p>two or more public clouds</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Physical hardware or virtual environment connected to at least one
            cloud
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Which work together to provide a flexible combination of cloud services.
        Hybrid Cloud Computing extends infrastructure and operations in a
        consistent manner to provide a single operating model that manages
        application workloads across both environments, enabling seamless
        migration of workloads from the private cloud to or from the public
        cloud based on business needs
      </p>
      <h2>Ways to build a hybrid cloud</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Traditional</u></p>
          <p>
            You need to connect the public cloud to the private cloud. A VPN is
            necessary, this one can be provided by most of the cloud computing
            service providers as part of their subscription packages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Modern</u></p>
          <p>
            No longer trying to interconnect. Development of applications as
            small independent sets of services Management will be done using a
            unified platform and a common operating system.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Orchestration abstracts all application requirements</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>The operating system abstracts all hardware requirements.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This model allows applications to be moved from one environment to
            another without using APls that change with every upgrade or change
            of cloud provider.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>6Rs of cloud migration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>Rehosting</u></p>
          <p>
            "Lift-and-shift" is one of the fastest and easiest cloud migration
            strategies that moves data without code-level changes.
            <br />
            Transfers without any changes operating systems from the current
            hosting environment to the public cloud infrastructure such as:
            applications, virtual machines, servers
            <br />
            Low-resistance migration method that can be automated using simple
            tools or manual to gain cloud maturity.
            <br />
            Limited use of cloud efficiency does not use cloud-native features
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>efficient CI/CD automation</p></li>
            <li><p>automatic scaling</p></li>
            <li><p>advanced monitoring systems</p></li>
            <li><p>automated recovery and self-healing</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Perhaps a starting point for large-scale optimization projects when
            organizations are looking to move their on-premises infrastructure
            in a short period of time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Replatforming</u></p>
          <p>
            Replatforming" is a strategy that allows you to make a few
            configuration changes to applications to better fit the cloud
            environment without changing their core architecture in order to
            achieve real benefits. <br />
            Replatforming involves changing the way applications interact
            together. <br />
            Reduce the time you spend managing database instances by migrating
            to a database-as-a-service cloud platform. More benefits of the
            cloud:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Reshape the procurement environment and make it cloud-enabled
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Refine application functionality</p></li>

          <p>Before migration to the cloud:</p>
          <ul>

          <p><u>Repurchasing</u></p>
          <p>
            The "Repurchasing" strategy, replaces the on-premises application
            with software provided by the cloud native provider.

          <ul>
            <li><p>Abandon existing or end-of-life license agreement</p></li>
            <li><p>Acquire a new platform or service in its place</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The upgraded cloud version offers you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>better value with increased efficiency</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Savings on application storage and maintenance costs.</p>

            <li><p>Tracking upgrades</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Point of attention:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Training your staff on the new software vendor</p></li>
            <li><p>Vendor lock-in</p></li>

            <li><p>lack of cloud skills</p></li>
            <li><p>delivery of complex projects and programs</p></li>
            <li><p>potentially significant business disruption</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The key is to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Prioritize small pieces of your monolithic application as
                microservices, then refactor them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Also allow legacy applications to run on-premises while you
                rebuild in the cloud to avoid disruption.

            </li>

          <p>Point of attention:</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Require more resources due to the increased complexity of its
                implementation.

            <li>
              <p>
                Most expensive, resource-intensive and time-consuming approach
                compared to others

            <li>
              <p>
                Defining a specific business objective at the start for example:
                availability or performance reliability of the application.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Possibility to completely rethink the logic of your application
                and develop the cloud native version from scratch.

        <li>
          <p><u>Retiring</u></p>
          <p>
            After assessment, deletion of applications that are not necessary
            for business.
            <br />
            This step will be accompanied by communications.
            <br />
            This may seem like a simple choice, but sometimes it has a high
            "moral" impact.

        <li>
          <p><u>Retaining</u></p>
          <p>
            This strategy is often used in hybrid cloud deployments by
            organizations to ensure business continuity during large-scale
            migrations that take several years. <br />
            Retain critical applications/parts that require significant
            refactoring before migrating them to the cloud. <br />
            Some components of your IT infrastructure may be retained on your
            existing infrastructure. For reasons.
