      <h1>Vector Spaces</h1>
      <h3>Notations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            $\mathbb{F}$ can be used instead of $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>$V$ is the vector space of $\mathbb{F}$.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Remark</h3>
      <p>
        The letter $\mathbb{F}$ is used because $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$
        are examples of what are called fields.
      </p>
      <h2>Lists and length</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose $n$ is a nonnegative integer. A list of length $n$ is an ordered
        collection of $n$-elements, of some mathematical objects, is separated
        by commas and surrounded by parentheses. A list of length $n$-looks like
        this:
      </p>
      $$ (x_1, \cdots , x_n) $$
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length and the
        same elements in the same order.
      </p>

      <h2>Field $\mathbb{F}^n$</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        $\mathbb{F}^n$ is the set of all lists of length $n$ of elements of
        $\mathbb{F}:
      </p>
      \[ \mathbb{F}^n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) : x_j \in \mathbb{F} \text{ for } j
      = 1, \ldots, n\} \]
      <p>
        For \((x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{F}^n\) and \(j \in \{1, \ldots,
        n\}\), we say that \(x_j\) is the \(j^{\text{th}}\) coordinate of
        \((x_1, \ldots, x_n)\)
      </p>

      <h2>Addition in $\mathbb{F}$</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Addition in \( \mathbb{F}^n \) is defined by adding corresponding
        coordinates:
      </p>
      \[ (x_1, \ldots, x_n) + (y_1, \ldots, y_n) = (x_1 + y_1, \ldots, x_n +
      y_n) \]

      <h2>Commutativity of addition in \(\mathbb{F}^n\)</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>If $x,y \in \mathbb{F}^n $, then $x + y = y + x$.</p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \) and \( y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n) \).
        Then
      </p>
      \[ x + y = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) + (y_1, \ldots, y_n) \] \[ = (x_1 + y_1,
      \ldots, x_n + y_n) \] \[ = (y_1 + x_1, \ldots, y_n + x_n) \] \[ = (y_1,
      \ldots, y_n) + (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \] \[ = y + x, \]
      <p>
        where the second and fourth equalities above hold because of the
        definition of addition in \( \mathbb{F}^n \) and the third equality
        holds because of the usual commutativity of addition in \( \mathbb{F}
        \).

      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Zero</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>Let 0 denote the list of length $n$-whose coordinates are all 0:</p>
      $$ 0 = (0, \ldots, 0) $$
      <h2>Additive inverse in \( \mathbb{F}^n \)</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        For \( x \in \mathbb{F}^n \), the additive inverse of \( x \), denoted
        \(-x\), is the vector \(-x \in \mathbb{F}^n\) such that
      </p>
      \[x + (-x) = 0\]

      <h2>Definition scalar multiplication in \( \mathbb{F}^n \)</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        The product of a number \( \lambda \) and a vector in \( \mathbb{F}^n \)
        is computed by multiplying each coordinate of the vector by \( \lambda
        \):
      </p>

      \[ \lambda(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (\lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n) \]
      <p>
        here \( \lambda \in \mathbb{F} \) and \( (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in
        \mathbb{F}^n \).
      </p>
      <h2>Addition and scalar multiplication</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            An addition on a set \( V \) is a function that assigns an element
            \( u + v \in V \) to each pair of elements \( u, v \in V \).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Scalar multiplication on a set \( V \) is a function that assigns an
            element \( \lambda v \in V \) to each \( \lambda \in F \) and each
            \( v \in V \).

      <h2>Unique additive identity</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>A vector space has a unique additive identity.</p>

      <h2>Unique additive inverse</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>Every element in a vector space has a unique additive inverse.</p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( v \) and \( w \) are both additive inverses of some element
        \( u \in V \). Then: \( v + u = 0 \) and \( w + u = 0 \)
        <br />
        Adding the additive inverse of \( v + u \) to both sides of the equation
        above gives \( 0 = w - v \), as desired.

      <h3>Proof</h3>
      $$ 0v = (0+0)v = 0v + 0v $$
      <p>
        Adding the additive inverse of $0v$ to both sides of the equation above

      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>$a0 = 0$ for every $a \in \mathbb{F}$.</p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      $$a0 = a (0+0) = a0 + a0 $$

        Adding the additive inverse of $a0$ to both sides of the equation above

      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>$(-1)v = -v$ for every $v \in V$.</p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      $$ v + (-1)v = 1v + (-1)v = (1+(-1))v = 0v = 0$$
      <p>
        This equation says that $(-1)v$, when added to $v$, gives 0. Thus
        $(-1)v$ is the additive inverse of $v$, as desired.

      <h2>Subspaces</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>A subset \( W \) of a vector space \( V \) is called a subspace if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>It contains the zero vector.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is closed under vector addition.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is closed under scalar multiplication.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sum of subsets</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( U \) and \( W \) be subsets of a vector space \( V \). The sum of
        \( U \) and \( W \), denoted \( U + W \), is the set defined by:
      </p>
      \[ U + W = \{ u + w \mid u \in U, w \in W \} \]
      <h2>Sum of subspaces is the smallest containing subspace</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( U_1, \ldots, U_m \) are subspaces of \( V \). Then \( U_1 +
        \cdots + U_m \) is the smallest subspace of \( V \) containing \( U_1,
        \ldots, U_m \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( W \) be the smallest subspace of \( V \) containing \( U_1,
        \ldots, U_m \). We need to show that \( W \) is contained in \( U_1 +
        \cdots + U_m \).
        <br />
        Since \( W \) is a subspace, it is closed under addition and scalar
        multiplication. Therefore, if \( w \in W \), then for any \( u_i \in U_i
        \) and \( \lambda \in \mathbb{F} \), we have \( w + u_i \in W \) and \(
        \lambda w \in W \).
        <br />
        Now, consider any element \( z \in U_1 + \cdots + U_m \). By definition,
        \( z \) can be written as \( z = u_1 + \cdots + u_m \) for some \( u_i
        \in U_i \). Since each \( U_i \) is contained in \( W \), it follows
        that \( z \in W \).
        <br />
        Thus, we have shown that \( W \subseteq U_1 + \cdots + U_m \), which
        proves the theorem.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Direct Sum</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>Suppose \( U_1, \ldots, U_m \) are subspaces of \( V \).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sum \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \) is called a direct sum if each
            element of \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \) can be written in only one way
            as a sum \( u_1 + \cdots + u_m \), where each \( u_j \) is in \( U_j
            \).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \) is a direct sum, then \( U_1 \oplus
            \cdots \oplus U_m \) denotes \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \), with the
            \(\oplus\) notation serving as an indication that this is a direct
            sum.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Condition for a direct sum</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( U_1, \ldots, U_m \) are subspaces of \( V \). Then \( U_1 +
        \cdots + U_m \) is a direct sum if and only if the intersection \( U_i
        \cap U_j = \{0\} \) for all \( i \neq j \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( U_1, \ldots, U_m \) are subspaces of \( V \). We will show
        that \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \) is a direct sum if and only if the
        intersection \( U_i \cap U_j = \{0\} \) for all \( i \neq j \).
        <br />
        (\( \Rightarrow \)) Assume \( U_1 + \cdots + U_m \) is a direct sum. Let
        \( v \in U_i \cap U_j \) for some \( i \neq j \). Then we can write \[ v
        = u_i + \cdots + u_m \] for some \( u_k \in U_k \). However, since \( v
        \in U_i \) and \( v \in U_j \), this representation is not unique,
        contradicting the assumption that the sum is direct. Thus, we must have
        \( v = 0 \), proving that \( U_i \cap U_j = \{0\} \).
        <br />
        (\( \Leftarrow \)) Now assume \( U_i \cap U_j = \{0\} \) for all \( i
        \neq j \). Let \( v \in U_1 + \cdots + U_m \). Then we can write \[ v =
        u_1 + \cdots + u_m \] for some \( u_k \in U_k \). Suppose there is
        another representation \[ v = w_1 + \cdots + w_m \] for some \( w_k \in
        U_k \). Then we have \[ u_1 + \cdots + u_m = w_1 + \cdots + w_m. \]
        Rearranging gives \[ (u_1 - w_1) + \cdots + (u_m - w_m) = 0. \] Since
        the \( U_i \) are pairwise disjoint, it follows that each \( u_k - w_k =
        0 \), proving the uniqueness of the representation. Thus, \( U_1 +
        \cdots + U_m \) is a direct sum.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Direct sum of two subspaces</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( U \) and \( W \) are subspaces of \( V \). Then \( U \oplus W
        \) is a direct sum if and only if \( U \cap W = \{0\} \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( U \) and \( W \) are subspaces of \( V \). We will show that
        \( U \oplus W \) is a direct sum if and only if \( U \cap W = \{0\} \).
        <br />
        (\( \Rightarrow \)) Assume \( U \oplus W \) is a direct sum. Let \( v
        \in U \cap W \). Then we can write \[ v = u + w \] for some \( u \in U
        \) and \( w \in W \). However, since \( v \in U \) and \( v \in W \),
        this representation is not unique, contradicting the assumption that the
        sum is direct. Thus, we must have \( v = 0 \), proving that \( U \cap W
        = \{0\} \).
        <br />
        (\( \Leftarrow \)) Now assume \( U \cap W = \{0\} \). Let \( v \in U
        \oplus W \). Then we can write \[ v = u + w \] for some \( u \in U \)
        and \( w \in W \). Suppose there is another representation \[ v = w_1 +
        w_2 \] for some \( w_k \in W \). Then we have \[ u + w = w_1 + w_2. \]
        Rearranging gives \[ (u - w_1) + (w - w_2) = 0. \] Since \( U \cap W =
        \{0\} \), it follows that each \( u - w_1 = 0 \) and \( w - w_2 = 0 \),
        proving the uniqueness of the representation. Thus, \( U \oplus W \) is
        a direct sum.
