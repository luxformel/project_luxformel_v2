      <h2>Linear combinations</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( V \) be a vector space over a field \( \mathbb{F} \). A linear
        combination of vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \in V \) is an
        expression of the form:
      </p>
      <p>\[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n \]</p>
      <p>
        where \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \in \mathbb{F} \) are scalars. The set of
        all linear combinations of a given set of vectors is called the span of
        those vectors.
      </p>
      <h2>Span</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        The span of a set of vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \in V \) is the
        set of all linear combinations of those vectors.
      </p>
      <h3>Notation</h3>
      <p>
        The span of the vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) is denoted by \(
        \text{span}(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \).
      </p>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        The span of a list of vectors in \( V \) is the smallest subspace of \(
        V \) containing all the vectors in the list.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( W \) be the span of the vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \). By
        definition, \( W \) is the set of all linear combinations of these
        vectors. Since \( W \) is formed by taking linear combinations of the
        vectors in the list, it is a subspace of \( V \).
        <br />
        Now, suppose there exists a subspace \( U \) of \( V \) that contains
        all the vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \). Since \( U \) is a
        subspace, it must also contain all linear combinations of these vectors.
        Therefore, we have \( W \subseteq U \).
        <br />
        Since \( U \) was an arbitrary subspace containing the vectors in the
        list, we conclude that \( W \) is the smallest subspace of \( V \)
        containing all the vectors in the list.

      <h2>Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A vector space is called finite-dimensional if some list of vectors in
        it spans the space.
      </p>
      <h2>Polynomial</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        The space of polynomials with coefficients in a field \( \mathbb{F} \)
        is denoted by \( \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F}) \). A polynomial \( p(x) \in
        \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F}) \) is an expression of the form:
      </p>
      <p>\[ p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0 \]</p>
      <p>
        where \( a_i \in \mathbb{F} \) for all \( i \) and \( n \) is a
        non-negative integer.
      </p>
      <h2>Degree of a polynomial</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        The degree of a polynomial \( p(x) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F}) \) is the
        highest power of \( x \) that appears in the polynomial with a non-zero
        coefficient. Formally, if
      </p>
      <p>\[ p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0 \]</p>
      <p>
        where \( a_n \neq 0 \), then the degree of \( p(x) \) is \( n \),
        denoted by \( \deg(p) = n \).
      </p>
      <h3>Remark</h3>
      <p>
        The polynomial that is identically 0 is said to have degree $-\infty$.
      </p>
      <h2>Space of polynomials</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        For a nonnegative integer \( m \), \( \mathcal{P}_m(\mathbb{F}) \)
        denotes the set of all polynomials with coefficients in \( \mathbb{F} \)
        and degree at most \( m \).
      </p>
      <h2>Infinite-dimensional vector space</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A vector space is called infinite-dimensional if it is not
        finite-dimensional.
      </p>
      <h2>Linearly independence</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A set of vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \in V \) is said to be
        linearly independent if the only linear combination of these vectors
        that equals the zero vector is the trivial combination where all
        coefficients are zero. Formally, if
      </p>
      \[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0 \]
      <p>
        implies \( c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_n = 0 \), then the vectors are
        linearly independent.
      </p>
      <h3>Remark</h3>
      <p>The empty list $()$ is also declared to be linearly independent.</p>
      <h2>Linearly dependent</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A set of vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \in V \) is said to be
        linearly dependent if there exist coefficients \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n
        \in \mathbb{F} \), not all zero, such that
      </p>
      \[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0 \]
      <p>
        In other words, at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear
        combination of the others.
      </p>
      <h3>Linear dependence lemma</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( v_1, \ldots, v_m \) is a linearly dependent list in \( V \).
        Then there exists \( j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \) such that the
        following hold:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>\( v_j \in \operatorname{span}(v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1}) \)</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            if the \( j^{\text{th}} \) term is removed from \( v_1, \ldots, v_m
            \), the span of the remaining list equals \(\operatorname{span}(v_1,
            \ldots, v_m)\).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        We will prove the linear dependence lemma by showing that if \( v_1,
        \ldots, v_m \) is a linearly dependent list in \( V \), then the two
        conditions stated in the lemma must hold for some \( j \in \{1, 2,
        \ldots, m\} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( v_1, \ldots, v_m \) is linearly dependent, there exist
        coefficients \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m \in \mathbb{F} \), not all zero,
        such that
      </p>
      \[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_m v_m = 0 \]
      <p>
        Without loss of generality, assume \( c_j \neq 0 \) for some \( j \in
        \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \). We can then express \( v_j \) as a linear
        combination of the other vectors:
      </p>
      \[ v_j = -\frac{c_1}{c_j} v_1 - \frac{c_2}{c_j} v_2 - \ldots -
      \frac{c_{j-1}}{c_j} v_{j-1} - \frac{c_{j+1}}{c_j} v_{j+1} - \ldots -
      \frac{c_m}{c_j} v_m \]
      <p>
        This shows that \( v_j \) can be expressed as a linear combination of
        the vectors \( v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1}, v_{j+1}, \ldots, v_m \), which
        proves the first condition of the lemma.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove the second condition, we note that removing \( v_j \) from the
        list does not change the span of the remaining vectors, since \( v_j \)
        can be expressed as a linear combination of them. Therefore, we have
      </p>
      \[ \operatorname{span}(v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1}, v_{j+1}, \ldots, v_m) =
      \operatorname{span}(v_1, \ldots, v_m) \]
      <p>This completes the proof of the linear dependence lemma.</p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Length of linearly independent list and length of spanning list</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        In a finite-dimensional vector space, the length of every linearly
        independent list of vectors is less than or equal to the length of every
        spanning list of vectors.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \) be a linearly independent list of
        vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space \( V \), and let \( u_1,
        u_2, \ldots, u_m \) be a spanning list of vectors in \( V \). We want to
        show that \( k \leq m \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m \) is a spanning list, every vector in \(
        V \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the \( u_i \)'s. In
        particular, the vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \) can be expressed as
        linear combinations of the \( u_i \)'s:
      </p>
      \[ v_j = a_{j1} u_1 + a_{j2} u_2 + \ldots + a_{jm} u_m \]
      <p>
        for some coefficients \( a_{ji} \in \mathbb{F} \). We can form the
        following matrix \( A \) whose columns are the vectors \( u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_m \) and whose rows correspond to the coefficients \( a_{ji}
        \):
      </p>
      \[ A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1m} \\ a_{21} &
      a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2m} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{k1} &
      a_{k2} & \cdots & a_{km} \end{pmatrix} \]
      <p>
        Since the vectors \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \) are linearly independent,
        the rows of the matrix \( A \) must be linearly independent as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in a finite-dimensional vector space, the maximum number of
        linearly independent vectors or the dimension is equal to the number of
        columns in the matrix \( A \). Therefore, we must have \( k \leq m \),
        which completes the proof.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Finite-dimensional subspaces</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is
        finite-dimensional.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( W \) be a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space \( V \).
        Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, there exists a finite basis \( \{
        v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \) for \( V \). We claim that the set \( \{
        v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \) spans \( W \).
      </p>
      <p>
        To see this, let \( w \in W \). Since \( W \) is a subspace, we can
        express \( w \) as a linear combination of the basis vectors of \( V \):
      </p>
      \[ w = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \ldots + a_k v_k \]
      <p>
        for some coefficients \( a_i \in \mathbb{F} \). However, since \( w \in
        W \) and \( W \) is closed under linear combinations, it follows that
        each \( v_i \) must also be expressible in terms of the basis vectors of
        \( W \). Thus, we can find a finite set of vectors in \( W \) that spans
        \( W \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, \( W \) is finite-dimensional, which completes the proof.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Basis</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A basis of \( V \) is a list of vectors in \( V \) that is linearly
        independent and spans \( V \).
      </p>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        A list \( v_1, \ldots, v_n \) of vectors in \( V \) is a basis of \( V
        \) if and only if every \( v \in V \) can be expressed as a linear
        combination of the \( v_i \)'s.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose \( v_1, \ldots, v_n \) is a basis of \( V \).
        Then by definition, the \( v_i \)'s are linearly independent and span \(
        V \). Therefore, every \( v \in V \) can be expressed as a linear
        combination of the \( v_i \)'s.
      </p>
      <p>
        $(\Leftarrow)$ Conversely, suppose every \( v \in V \) can be expressed
        as a linear combination of the \( v_i \)'s. We need to show that the \(
        v_i \)'s are linearly independent. Assume for the sake of contradiction
        that they are not linearly independent. Then there exists a non-trivial
        linear combination of the \( v_i \)'s that equals zero:
      </p>
      \[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0 \]
      <p>
        for some coefficients \( c_i \in \mathbb{F} \), not all zero. But then
        we could express one of the \( v_i \)'s as a linear combination of the
        others, contradicting the assumption that the \( v_i \)'s span \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the \( v_i \)'s must be linearly independent, and we conclude
        that \( v_1, \ldots, v_n \) is a basis of \( V \).
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Spanning list contains a basis</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Every spanning list in a vector space can be reduced to a basis of the
        vector space.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) be a spanning list in a vector space \(
        V \). We will show that we can reduce this list to a basis for \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we can apply the process of Gaussian elimination to the vectors
        \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) to obtain a set of linearly independent
        vectors \( u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \) (where \( k \leq n \)) that still
        spans \( V \). This is possible because the original vectors span \( V
        \), and we can remove any linear dependencies among them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we claim that the set \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \} \) is a basis
        for \( V \). To see this, we need to show that it is linearly
        independent and spans \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we obtained \( u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \) from \( v_1, v_2, \ldots,
        v_n \) through a process that removes linear dependencies, it follows
        that the \( u_i \)'s are linearly independent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, because the \( v_i \)'s span \( V \), any vector \( v \in V
        \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the \( v_i \)'s:
      </p>
      \[ v = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \ldots + a_n v_n \]
      <p>
        Since the \( u_i \)'s are obtained from the \( v_i \)'s, we can also
        express \( v \) as a linear combination of the \( u_i \)'s:
      </p>
      \[ v = b_1 u_1 + b_2 u_2 + \ldots + b_k u_k \]
      <p>
        for some coefficients \( b_i \in \mathbb{F} \). This shows that the \(
        u_i \)'s span \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, we conclude that \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \} \) is a basis
        for \( V \), and we have successfully reduced the spanning list \( v_1,
        v_2, \ldots, v_n \) to a basis.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>
      <h2>Basis of finite-dimensional vector space</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis.</p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( V \) be a finite-dimensional vector space. By definition, this
        means that there exists a finite spanning list \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n
        \) of vectors in \( V \). We will show that we can reduce this spanning
        list to a basis for \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        By the previous theorem, we know that every spanning list can be reduced
        to a basis. Therefore, we can apply this result to our spanning list \(
        v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) to obtain a basis \( u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \)
        for \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, we conclude that every finite-dimensional vector space has a
        basis.
      </p>
      <p class="square">$\square$</p>

      <h2>Linearly independent list extends to a basis</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional
        vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( V \) be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let \( \{ v_1,
        v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \) be a linearly independent list of vectors in \( V
        \). Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, it has a basis \( \{ u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_n \} \) with \( n \) vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can extend the list \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \) to a basis of
        \( V \) by adding vectors from the basis \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \}
        \) that are not in the span of \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, we can take a vector \( u_i \) from the basis \( \{ u_1,
        u_2, \ldots, u_n \} \) that is not in the span of \( \{ v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_k \} \) and add it to our list. This new list \( \{ v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_k, u_i \} \) will still be linearly independent, as the
        addition of \( u_i \) does not introduce any linear dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can repeat this process until we have added enough vectors to form a
        basis for \( V \). Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, this process
        must terminate, and we will obtain a basis for \( V \) that extends the
        original linearly independent list \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k \} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, we conclude that every linearly independent list of vectors
        in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the
        vector space.

      <p>
        Let \( V \) be a finite-dimensional vector space and \( U \) be a
        subspace of \( V \). Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, we can choose
        a basis \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \} \) for \( U \) and extend it to a
        basis \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m \} \) for \( V
        \).
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim that \( V = U \oplus W \), where \( W = \text{span}\{ v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_m \} \). To show this, we need to verify two things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            \( V = U + W \): Any vector \( v \in V \) can be expressed as a
            linear combination of the basis vectors, so we can write \[ v = a_1
            u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_k u_k + b_1 v_1 + b_2 v_2 + \ldots + b_m
            v_m \] for some scalars \( a_i \) and \( b_j \). This shows that \(
            V \) is the sum of \( U \) and \( W \).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            \( U \cap W = \{ 0 \} \): If a vector \( x \) is in both \( U \) and
            \( W \), it can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis
            vectors for \( U \) and \( W \). However, since the basis vectors
            for \( W \) are not in \( U \), the only vector that can be in both
            subspaces is the zero vector. Thus, \( U \cap W = \{ 0 \} \).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Since both conditions are satisfied, we conclude that \( V = U \oplus W
        \).

      <h2>Basis length does not depend on basis</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same length.
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \} \) be a basis for the
        finite-dimensional vector space \( V \), and let \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots,
        v_m \} \) be another basis for \( V \). We need to show that \( n = m
        \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m \} \) is a basis for \( V \), it is
        linearly independent and spans \( V \). Therefore, each vector \( u_i \)
        can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors \( v_j \):
      </p>
      \[ u_i = a_{i1} v_1 + a_{i2} v_2 + \ldots + a_{im} v_m \]
      <p>
        for some scalars \( a_{ij} \). This means that the set \( \{ u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_n \} \) is also linearly dependent on the set \( \{ v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_m \} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, since \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \} \) is a basis for \( V
        \), each vector \( v_j \) can be expressed as a linear combination of
        the vectors \( u_i \):
      </p>
      \[ v_j = b_{j1} u_1 + b_{j2} u_2 + \ldots + b_{jn} u_n \]
      <p>
        for some scalars \( b_{ji} \). This means that the set \( \{ v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_m \} \) is also linearly dependent on the set \( \{ u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_n \} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since both sets are linearly dependent on each other, we conclude that
        they must have the same number of vectors, \( n = m \).
      </p>

      <h2>Dimension</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        The dimension of a vector space \( V \) is defined as the length of any
        basis of \( V \).
      </p>
      <h3>Notation</h3>
      <p>
        The dimension of a vector space \( V \) is denoted by \( \dim(V) \).
      </p>
      <h2>Dimension of a subspace</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        If \( V \) is finite-dimensional and \( U \) is a subspace of \( V \),
        then \( \dim(U) \leq \dim(V) \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \} \) be a basis for the subspace \( U
        \) and extend it to a basis \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k, v_1, v_2,
        \ldots, v_m \} \) for \( V \). Since the basis for \( U \) has \( k \)
        vectors and the basis for \( V \) has \( k + m \) vectors, we have
      </p>
      \[ \dim(U) = k \leq k + m = \dim(V). \]

      <h2>Linearly independent list of the right length is a basis</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( V \) is finite-dimensional. Then every linearly independent
        list of vectors in \( V \) with length \( \dim(V) \) is a basis of \( V
        \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) be a linearly independent list of
        vectors in \( V \) with length \( n = \dim(V) \). We need to show that
        this list is a basis for \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( n = \dim(V) \), any basis for \( V \) must also have \( n \)
        vectors. We can extend the list \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) to a
        basis for \( V \) by adding vectors from \( V \) that are not in the
        span of the \( v_i \)'s.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, since \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) is linearly
        independent, it cannot be expressed as a linear combination of any other
        vectors in \( V \). Therefore, the only way to extend this list to a
        basis is to include all \( n \) vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, we conclude that \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) is a basis for
        \( V \).

      <h2>Spanning list of the right length is a basis</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose \( V \) is finite-dimensional. Then every spanning list of
        vectors in \( V \) with length \( \dim V \) is a basis of \( V \).
      </p>
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) be a spanning list of vectors in
        \( V \) with length \( n = \dim(V) \). We need to show that this list is
        a basis for \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( n = \dim(V) \), any basis for \( V \) must also have \( n \)
        vectors. We can extend the list \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) to a
        basis for \( V \) by adding vectors from \( V \) that are not in the
        span of the \( v_i \)'s.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, since \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) is spanning, it must be
        able to express any vector in \( V \) as a linear combination of the \(
        v_i \)'s. Therefore, the only way to extend this list to a basis is to
        include all \( n \) vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, we conclude that \( \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \} \) is a basis for
        \( V \).

      <h2>Dimension of a sum</h2>
      <h3>Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        If \( U \) and \( W \) are finite-dimensional subspaces of a vector
        space \( V \), then
      </p>
      \[ \dim(U + W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W). \]
      <h3>Proof</h3>
      <p>
        Let \( \{ u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k \} \) be a basis for \( U \) and \( \{
        w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_m \} \) be a basis for \( W \). Then \( \{ u_1, u_2,
        \ldots, u_k, w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_m \} \) spans \( U + W \).
      </p>
      <p>
        To show that this set is linearly independent, we need to consider the
        intersection \( U \cap W \). Let \( \{ z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_p \} \) be a
        basis for \( U \cap W \). Then we can express the dimensions as follows:
      </p>
      \[ \dim(U + W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W). \]
